# Biography
Iâ€™m a 20 year old university student taking up Computer Science in Manila. I love learning, building and doing just about anything with code. If I'm not programming, I'm probably studying for my university classes, designing a UI of sorts, taking a few [photos](http://diezcami.vsco.co), or painting.

# Skills
Right now, I'm passionate about learning Go and Ruby (on Rails), as I find web development enjoyable and beneficial to my projects in many aspects. I use C++, Java and Python regularly in the context of school work and open source contributions, though I'm also experienced with several other languages such as C and C#.
