I just configured up [Sublime Text 3 build 3083](link) with [sublime-jekyll](https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll) a Sublime Text package for Jekyll static sites. This provides the quick functionality to create new blog post. I will explain later how I put up the whole site together and thoughts about it.
I added [MarkdownEditing](markdown-editing) on the top to get a better feel for the markdown, I am still testin it out.


Time to push this post out.
