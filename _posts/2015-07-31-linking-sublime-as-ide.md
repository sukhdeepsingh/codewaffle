I just configured up [link](Sublime Text 3 build 3083) with [link2](sublime-jekyll) a Sublime Text package for Jekyll static sites. This provides the quick functionality to create new blog post. I will explain later how I put up the whole site together and thoughts about it.
I added [markdown-editing](MarkdownEditing) on the top to get a better feel for the markdown, I am still testin it out.

Time to push this post out.
