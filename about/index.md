I am from land of 5 rivers called Punjab and from a country where you find the most exotic places, best curries, rich culture and amazing people known as INDIA. I am currently living in Dresden, Germany and pursuing my PhD. 


I love hiking. I like travelling n' talking to people, or doing something adventurous. If I am not doing any of these, you can find me Djing, Biking, playing Frisbee, Table Tennis, or something new that I have just heard of :) Mother nature makes me complete, being more wild and raw. I love to adventure and in this beautiful life, I want to gather most experiences I can get. I want to walk the world, hike the summits and dive the oceans, and the more I do it, more I feel I have done nothing. Being from a warrior clan (Sikh), I like to take risks and be brave, nothing is better then getting a new experience. Life is awesome and everyday is an opportunity to meet great people, learn, experience and do the undone. Most Pictures are my own :)
